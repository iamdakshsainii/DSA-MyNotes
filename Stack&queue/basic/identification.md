## 🧩 Stack Trigger Keywords in Questions
🔑 Keyword	🧠 Why It Screams “Stack”
adjacent	You're checking/removing items next to each other (last-in-first-checked)
next greater / next smaller	Use monotonic stack to track increasing or decreasing order
previous greater/smaller	Stack helps you track previous elements efficiently
remove pairs / cancel out	Stack lets you pop the top if current is a matching/cancelling value
balanced parentheses/brackets	Open brackets go in the stack, and matched when a close one comes
