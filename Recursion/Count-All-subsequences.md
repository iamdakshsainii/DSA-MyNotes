### Problem: Count all subsequences with sum K

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of all elements in the subsequence equals `k`.

#### Approach:

We can solve this problem using **backtracking** (recursion). The idea is to explore all subsequences of the given array and check if their sum matches the target `k`. For each element in the array, we have two choices:
1. **Include** the element in the current subsequence.
2. **Exclude** the element from the current subsequence.

We will try both possibilities recursively and keep track of the subsequences whose sum matches `k`.

#### Recursive Function Breakdown:

The helper function `countSeq(int index, int sum, int[] nums)` is responsible for recursively exploring the subsequences. Here's how it works:

1. **Base case 1:** If `sum == 0`, this means we have found a valid subsequence that sums to `k`. So, return 1.
2. **Base case 2:** If `sum < 0` or `index == nums.length`, it means the sum is not valid or we've exhausted all elements, so return 0.
3. **Recursive case:** For the current element `nums[index]`, we have two options:
    - **Include the current element:** Subtract `nums[index]` from `sum` and move to the next element (`index + 1`).
    - **Exclude the current element:** Just move to the next element (`index + 1`) without changing `sum`.

The result for the current index is the sum of these two choices.

#### Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    private int countSeq(int index, int sum, int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;

        // Base case: if sum == 0, we've found a valid subsequence
        if (sum == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Base case: if sum < 0 or we've gone beyond the array, no valid subsequence
        if (sum < 0 || index == nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Recurse by including the current element or excluding it
        return countSeq(index + 1, sum - nums[index], nums) + countSeq(index + 1, sum, nums);
    }

    public int countSubsequenceWithTargetSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Start the recursive function with the initial parameters
        return countSeq(0, k, nums);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity** of the recursive approach is O(2^N), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element has two choices (to include or exclude), leading to an exponential number of possible subsets.

**Space Complexity** is O(N), where n is the maximum depth of the recursion stack. This depth corresponds to the number of elements in the array being considered at any given time.


## **Key Points To Learn**
**1. Space Complexity :**
**Recursion Stack:** The space used by the recursion stack depends on how deep the recursion goes. In the case of exploring all paths, the depth of recursion is proportional to the number of elements in the array, n. Since each recursive call explores one element, the maximum depth of the recursion stack will be O(n).

**2. Base Condition:** Stops exploring a single path, doesnâ€™t stop the whole recursion. Recursion will still explore other branches. agr array h to ek condition last index tk pahuchne ki bhi hogi hi

**3.****Recursion** is for counting or checking answers, not generating paths. Backtracking is used when we need to generate or store all possible paths. to jb bhi hume output m single value chahiye not all possible stuff to hum recursion use krenge and explore both paths

**4. Count Works:** You add results from both left and right branches. Recursion only terminates once all paths are checked, then you add up the valid paths (1s) and invalid paths (0s).
to apne aap count hota rhega hume expliclty nhi krna vo recursion dekh lega
