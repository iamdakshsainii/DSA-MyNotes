>> If you're dealing with small or moderate-sized datasets, and 
flexibility or ease of use is important, using ArrayList and HashSet is a great option.

>> If you're concerned about performance or memory efficiency, 
and the size of the data is known or fixed, arrays are the better 
choice as they have minimal overhead and offer faster performance.
