Used for occurance 
in string also used but change to chararray then same as array

Purpose of the Line:
This line is used to count the frequency of each character in a string. 
It updates the frequency map (freqMap) where each character c is a key, and its corresponding value 
is the number of times that character appears in the string.

Detailed Explanation:
freqMap.getOrDefault(c, 0):
freqMap.get(c): This part tries to retrieve the value associated with the key c in the freqMap. 
If the character c is already in the map, freqMap.get(c) will return the current count (frequency) of that character.
getOrDefault(c, 0): If c is not found in the map, it returns the default value 0. 
This ensures that if a character hasn't been seen before, its count is treated as 0. 
This avoids a NullPointerException if the character isn't already in the map.

Example:
If the character c = 't' is encountered for the first time, freqMap.getOrDefault('t', 0) will return 0, 
since 't' is not in the map yet.
If c = 'e' is encountered later, and 'e' is already in the map with a frequency of 2, freqMap.getOrDefault('e', 0) will return 2.
