1. Brute mostly use stack,list or array to store the value
2. comman thing to remember when use linkedlist question are - middle,reverse,add vala question
3. if you need to find the intersection point of two linked list then use hashset to store the address of one list and then check if the address is present in other list if yes then return the address else return null - better
and also brute would be use 2 pointer one is at one place and traverse second aprt by checking and if not move first and check again
4. mostly question can be solve by hashset,array etc
5. wherever you find cycle mean brute can be solve ny simple array or hashing and optimal by tortoise technique


## important
in cycle
always take a case if no cycle then null, like in length what mistake i did was i get correct code but only forgot to handle case of if no loop (i had return the null  but forgot to ensure for length you can see reference in related side file)
