1. Brute mostly use stack,list or array to store the value
2. comman thing to remember when use linkedlist question are - middle,reverse,add vala question
3. if you need to find the intersection point of two linked list then use hashset to store the address of one list and then check if the address is present in other list if yes then return the address else return null - better
and also brute would be use 2 pointer one is at one place and traverse second aprt by checking and if not move first and check again
