### **List of Problems That Can Use the Tortoise and Hare Technique** ðŸš€

The **Tortoise and Hare (Slow-Fast Pointer)** technique is useful in problems involving **linked lists** and **cyclic structures**. Hereâ€™s a categorized list of problems where you can apply this technique:

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 1. Finding the Middle of a Linked List**

- **Problem:** Given a singly linked list, find the middle node.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If the problem asks for the **middle element** in **O(n) time with O(1) space**.âœ… If traversing the list **once** is necessary.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Find the Middle of the Linked List* (LeetCode #876)

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 2. Detecting a Cycle in a Linked List**

- **Problem:** Given a linked list, check if there is a cycle.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If the problem mentions a "loop" or "cycle" in a linked list.âœ… If a solution is required in **O(n) time with O(1) space**.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Linked List Cycle* (LeetCode #141)
- **Key Insight:** If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 3. Finding the Starting Point of a Cycle**

- **Problem:** If a cycle exists, find the **first node** where the cycle starts.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If the problem asks for the **entry point** of a loop.âœ… If **cycle detection** is already solved.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Linked List Cycle II* (LeetCode #142)
- **Key Insight:** Once fast and slow meet inside the loop, move one pointer to the head and move both at the same speed. They will meet at the **start of the cycle**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 4. Finding the K-th Node from the End**

- **Problem:** Given a linked list, find the k-th node from the end.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If you are required to find an element **without counting the length** first.âœ… If **two pointers moving at different speeds** can be useful.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Remove Nth Node From End of List* (LeetCode #19)
- **Key Insight:** Use a fast pointer moving `k` steps ahead, then move both pointers one step at a time.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 5. Checking if a List is a Palindrome**

- **Problem:** Determine if a linked list is a palindrome.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If the problem involves **checking symmetry**.âœ… If itâ€™s possible to **split the list into two halves**.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Palindrome Linked List* (LeetCode #234)
- **Key Insight:** Use slow-fast pointers to find the **middle**, then reverse the second half and compare.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 6. Finding the Intersection of Two Linked Lists**

- **Problem:** Find the node where two linked lists intersect.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If two lists have **different lengths** but merge at a common node.âœ… If a **two-pointer** approach could work.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Intersection of Two Linked Lists* (LeetCode #160)
- **Key Insight:** Use slow-fast pointers to navigate both lists efficiently.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 7. Detecting Circular Arrays (Cycle in an Array)**

- **Problem:** Given an array where each index represents a step size, detect if there's a cycle.
- **When to Guess?**âœ… If elements move like a **circular path**.âœ… If **repeating indices** indicate a cycle.
- **Example Problem:**
    - *Linked List Cycle (Array Variant)*
- **Key Insight:** Treat the array like a **linked list** where indices act as pointers.

### **ðŸ’¡ How to Guess When to Use Tortoise and Hare?**

1. âœ… **Single traversal with two pointers** is required.
2. âœ… **Cycle detection, middle element, or two-pointer logic** is involved.
3. âœ… **Efficient O(n) time and O(1) space is needed.**
